          Hello there! Thank you for demoing my page. So my name is Allison Juliette Snipes. If you notice my last name--you might think you know it from somewhere? SO STORYTIME! I am related to Wesley Snipes the famous protagonist from the Blade series. True story.. and if I could tell you a secret--I've never seen any of the Blade movies. But I do enjoy a vampire flick now and then

          I really enjoy coding--and mostly up until this point in my coding journey I am self taught. I mainly just inspected cool websites that I found, and read the various html, js, and css files. Eventually, I tried other bootcamps until I stumbled upon UCB program. Becoming a Full Stack Web Dev is not my end goal--hopefully I will acheive my goal of becoming a Cybersecurity professional.
